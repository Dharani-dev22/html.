<p>Some of the ways network connections harm animals include:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>Electromagnetic radiation from cell towers and Wi-Fi routers affecting bird migration and communication</li>
<li>E-waste from discarded electronics polluting habitats and harming wildlife</li>
<li>Climate change caused by energy consumption from network infrastructure affecting ecosystems</li>
</ul>
<h2 align="center"> 10,000</h2>
<p>Tons of e-waste generated annually</p>
           
            
<h2 align="center">50%</h2>
<p>Increase in electromagnetic radiation from cell towers</p>
           
            
<h2 align=center>20%</h2>
<p>Decline in bird populations due to habitat destruction</p>
            
<h2 align=center>Take Action</h2>
<p>Here are some ways you can reduce your digital footprint and protect animals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use eco-friendly electronics</li>
